# jenkins-laravel-template

Template build configuration files for use with the docker-jenkins-php project

- build.xml: Apache Ant build file, see <https://ant.apache.org/manual/using.html>, needed for FreeStyle Projects in Jenkins
- Jenkinsfile: Declarative Script for Pipeline project in Jenkins (recommended instead of FreeStyle project!)
- build/phpcs.xml: config file for PHP Code Sniffer <https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer>
- build/phpdox.xml: config file for PHP Documentation Generator <http://phpdox.net/>
- build/phpmd.xml: config file for PHP Mess Detector <https://phpmd.org/>
- .deployment_exclude: all files and directories are excluded in the rsync for deployment

## Usage

add build-directory and Jenkinsfile/.deployment_exclude OR build.xml to your GIT-project.

> Do NOT forget the .gitignore file in the build-directory, otherwise you'll have all reports in your next commit.

> Also do NOT forget to pass XDEBUG_MODE=coverage to the Jenkins installation, otherwise phpunit won't generate code coverage reports

> You may also set environment, so CSS/Images from Code coverage report are loaded:
  ```JAVA_OPTS=-Dhudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP="sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts; default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; font-src 'self'"```


### optional steps

#### Pipeline project

1. modify the "Environment" stage for the correct environment file

#### FreeStyle project

1. change the name of the project php-template to your real project name
2. change the .env-filename in the target "env-production" (or just remove target from build lists)
